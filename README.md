# sorting_algorithms
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the exploration of sorting algorithms, Big O analysis, and their implementation in the C programming language. This project, completed for ALX Software Engineering, is a collaborative effort carried out by teams of two individuals, with the following team members: Dennis Adigwe and Kingsley Ikejemba.




1. Insertion sort

    1-insertion_sort_list.c: C function that sorts a listint_t doubly-linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
    Prints the list after each swap.
    1-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Insertion Sort algorithm, one per line.
