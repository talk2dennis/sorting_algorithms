# sorting_algorithms
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the exploration of sorting algorithms, Big O analysis, and their implementation in the C programming language. This project, completed for ALX Software Engineering, is a collaborative effort carried out by teams of two individuals, with the following team members: Dennis Adigwe and Kingsley Ikejemba.




1. Insertion sort

    1-insertion_sort_list.c: C function that sorts a listint_t doubly-linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
    Prints the list after each swap.
    1-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Insertion Sort algorithm, one per line.

2. Selection sort


    2-selection_sort.c: C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.
    Prints the array after each swap.
    2-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Selection Sort algorithm, one per line.


3.  Quick sort

    3-quick_sort.c: C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick Sort algorithm.
    Implements the Lomuto partition scheme.
    Always uses the last element of the partition being sorted as the pivot.
    Prints the array after each swap.
    3-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Quick Sort Lomuto Partition scheme algorithm, one per line.
